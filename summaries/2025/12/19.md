# Activity Summary for 12/19/2025

## 10:27:46 AM
The log primarily details the setup process for a "CMIS - Case Registration" project, encompassing both backend and frontend components, and subsequent environment configuration.

For the file `c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\setup`, recorded at 12/19/2025, 9:28:56 AM and again at 9:29:14 AM, the content outlines a comprehensive guide for project setup. This includes:
*   **Project Cloning:** Instructions to clone the `cmis-case-registration` repository from GitHub.
*   **Backend Setup:**
    *   Creating and activating a Python virtual environment.
    *   Installing Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    *   Configuring environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and editing it. The guide suggests setting `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, database credentials (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`), JWT lifetimes, Redis URL, and station details (`STATION_CODE`, `STATION_NAME`).
    *   Generating a Django `SECRET_KEY` using a Python command.
    *   Running database migrations, with specific troubleshooting steps for `users`, `departments`, `cases`, and `movements` relations not existing.
    *   Creating a superuser with predefined credentials (admin, admin@cmis.gov.mw).
    *   Checking the setup and starting the Django backend server.
*   **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Installing Node.js dependencies using `npm install`, including troubleshooting for certificate errors.
    *   Configuring frontend environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and editing it.
    *   Starting the frontend development server.
*   **Verification:** Steps to verify both backend and frontend by accessing specific URLs.

Regarding the files `c:\cmis-case-registration\backend\.env` and `c:\cmis-case-registration\backend\.env.example`, logged with timestamps 12/19/2025 at 9:46:09 AM, 9:47:57 AM, 9:48:38 AM, and 9:48:47 AM: these files contain environment variables, some of which are sensitive (e.g., secret keys, database passwords, API keys). As per instructions, their specific content will not be summarized.

For the file `c:\cmis-case-registration\frontend\.env.local`, updated at 12/19/2025, 10:03:56 AM, it defines key frontend environment variables:
*   `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api`
*   `VITE_API_TIMEOUT=30000`
*   `VITE_APP_NAME="CMIS - Case Registration"`
*   `VITE_STATION_CODE=LLW`

**Key Patterns and Timestamps:**
All changes occurred on the same date, 12/19/2025. The initial setup guide was logged twice in quick succession (9:28 AM to 9:29 AM). Subsequent changes, occurring between 9:46 AM and 10:03 AM, indicate a focused session on configuring the backend and frontend environment variables after the initial setup instructions were laid out. A recurring pattern is the use of `copy .env.example .env` (or `.env.local`) as a standard practice for setting up environment variables in both backend and frontend components. The overall theme is a detailed, step-by-step installation and configuration of a full-stack web application.
