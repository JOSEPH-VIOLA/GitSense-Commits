# Activity Summary for 12/21/2025

## 9:54:57 PM
The `c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\setup` file, timestamped 12/21/2025, 9:09:03 PM, outlines a comprehensive guide for setting up the `cmis-case-registration` project. The instructions cover both backend and frontend components, detailing a consistent pattern of environment setup, dependency installation, and server initiation.

Key information from this file includes:

*   **Project Cloning and Navigation:** Initial steps involve cloning the `cmis-case-registration` repository from GitHub and navigating into its directory.
*   **Backend Setup (Python/Django):**
    *   **Virtual Environment:** Instructions for creating and activating a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
    *   **Dependency Installation:** Upgrading `pip` and installing Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Environment Configuration:** Guidance on creating a `.env` file from `.env.example` and configuring essential settings such as `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, database connection details (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT), JWT lifetimes, Redis URL, and station-specific codes/names. It specifically notes that the `DB_PASSWORD` should be changed and `DB_HOST` might require adjustment for Windows/Docker.
    *   **Secret Key Generation:** A command is provided to generate a unique Django `SECRET_KEY` for security, which needs to be updated in the `.env` file.
    *   **Database Migrations:** Running `python manage.py migrate` is specified, with explicit commands for `users`, `departments`, `cases`, and `movements` if initial migration errors related to non-existent relations occur.
    *   **Superuser Creation:** Instructions for creating an administrator superuser.
    *   **Server Start & Verification:** Commands to check the Django project and start the backend development server, followed by steps to verify functionality via browser access to `http://localhost:8000/` and `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.
*   **Frontend Setup (Node.js/React):**
    *   **Dependency Installation:** Instructions to navigate to the `frontend` directory and install Node.js dependencies using `npm install`. Solutions for potential certificate or peer dependency errors are also provided.
    *   **Environment Configuration:** Guidance on creating a `.env.local` file from `.env.example` and configuring frontend-specific environment variables like `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_API_TIMEOUT`, `VITE_APP_NAME`, and `VITE_STATION_CODE`.
    *   **Server Start & Verification:** Commands to start the frontend development server (`npm run dev`) and verify its functionality by accessing `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment Configuration:** Both backend and frontend follow a consistent pattern of copying an `.env.example` file to an active environment file (`.env` for backend, `.env.local` for frontend) and then editing it to configure specific variables.
*   **Dependency Management:** Both components require dedicated dependency installations using their respective package managers (`pip` for Python, `npm` for Node.js).
*   **Server Start and Verification:** Each component concludes with instructions to start its respective development server and verify its operational status via browser access.
*   **Troubleshooting Tips:** The guide includes specific troubleshooting advice, such as setting execution policy for PowerShell, handling `npm install` certificate errors, and resolving initial Django migration issues.
